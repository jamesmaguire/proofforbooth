#+attr_html: :id scheduletable
| Week | Start of week | Workouts |
|------+---------------+----------|
|    1 | 2 April 2022 | 1, 2, 3  |
|    2 | 9 April 2022 | 1, 2, 3  |
|    3 | 16 April 2022 | 1, 2, 3  |

* General principles

- In this phase, your primary goal is to feel both physically and psychologically prepared for your most important tournament. Trust your training. You will be dramatically decreasing your volume of work. It is important to realize that you've already done the work necessary. Gains in performance are now going to come from complete recovery, not from training.
- Workouts will be done at the same intensity. Sprinting and lifting at high intensity are still important for two reasons. 1. You want to keep your mobility. Being inactive or not sprinting may cause a temporary loss of movement quality. 2. We want to keep the nervous system primed for peak performance. High-intensity movements keep the nervous system sharp.
