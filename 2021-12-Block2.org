#+attr_html: :id scheduletable
| Week | Start of week    | Workouts |
|------+------------------+----------|
|    1 | 29 November 2021 | 1, 2, 3  |
|    2 | 6 December 2021  | 1, 2, 3  |
|    3 | 13 December 2021 | 1, 2, 3  |
|    4 | 20 December 2021 | 1, 2, 3  |

* General principles

- SAQ (speed agility quickness) + Conditioning sessions should take around 45 minutes.
- Ensure you are respecting the full rest between sets during SAQ exercises. It will seem like a long time, but it's designed that way for a reason.
- SAQ workouts are not conditioning. Do not do more than what is listed. You should feel fully recovered between reps and sets. If not, add more rest. No big deal.
- If doing two types of sessions on the same day, SAQ should be done before lifting or conditioning. Lifting should be done before conditioning.
